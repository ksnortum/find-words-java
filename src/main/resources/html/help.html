<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	<span class="emphasis">ScrabbleWords</span> will help you find words to play in 
	the game of Scrabble.
	You enter letters of the tiles you have in your hand.  Optionally, you can enter
	a letter or letters on the board that the suggested word must contain.  You can 
	also enter the letters the suggested word must start with and end with.  Four
	dictionaries are supported: The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, or OSPD;
	the Official Tournament and Club Word List, or TWL; and COLLINS (formerly called
	SOWPODS), which is used in most countries outside the USA, and COLLINS_DEFINE,
	which is the Collins dictionary with definitions.  The WORDS dictionary is designed
	to work in crossword mode.  It's the standard Linux "words" dictionary without any
	entries that have an apostrophe in them.
</p>
<p>
	If you are familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
	Regular Expressions</a> you can use them in <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span>
	to limit your search.  
</p>
<p>
	A list of suggested words is displayed when you press <span class="button">
	Submit</span> or press the <span class="key">Enter</span> key.  All entered data 
	is cleared when the <span class="button">Clear</span> button is pressed.  
	The <span class="button">Clear Except Avail</span> button will clear all fields
	except the <span class="quote">Available Letters</span> field.
	The application can be closed with the <span class="key">Escape</span> button.
	The suggested words are displayed first by highest value first and then if the 
	values are the same, by alphabetical order. 
</p>
<p>
	<span class="emphasis">ScrabbleWords</span> has a limited ability to detect
	whether a word is a bingo (with an extra 50 points).  Specifically, it may fail
	to catch bingos if <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span> contains certain 
	regular expressions.  This means it is possible (but not
	likely) that a bingo word may not display first in the suggested word list. 
</p>

<h2 id="available">Available Letters</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Enter the letters of the tiles in your hand.  If you have blank tiles, enter these as
	dots (.). 
</p>

<h2 id="contains">Contains Letters</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>	
	Enter letters on the board that the suggested word will intersect.  
	Regular expressions are allowed.  The regex will be tested to make sure it is a
	valid Java regular expression.  
</p>

<h2 id="startswith">Starts With</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Enter the letter or letters the suggested words should start with. 
</p>

<h2 id="endswith">Ends With</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Enter the letter or letters the suggested words should end with. 
</p>

<h2 id="capitals">Use of Capital Letters</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	The <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span>, <span class="quote">Starts With</span>, 
	and <span class="quote">Ends With</span> fields will all take capital
	letters.  These have a special meaning, best illustrated by an example.  
</p>
<p>
	Say there is a letter on the board, "m", and you know you want to take a letter from
	your hand, "a", to make a word that contains "ma".  You could remove the "a" from your
	<span class="quote">Available Letters</span> field and enter "ma" in the <span class="quote">
	Contains Letters</span> field.  However, you now have to remember to put back the "a" 
	if you look for another list of words with different settings.
</p>
<p>
	The shortcut for this is to use capital letters in the <span class="quote">
	Contains Letters</span>, <span class="quote">Starts With</span>, or <span class="quote">
	Ends With</span> fields.  Entering "mA" in the <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span>
	field means, I want to see a list of all words that contain "ma", but first remove one
	"a" from the <span class="quote">Available Letters</span> field.
</p>
<h2 id="dictionary">Dictionary</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Select the dictionary to use.  The default is COLLINS.  Selecting the COLLINS_DEFINE
	dictionary will display definitions after the suggested word and score.

</p>
<p>
<h2 id="crossword">Crossword Mode</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	ScrabbleWords can also help while playing crosswords.  Selecting Crossword Mode disables 
	the "two dots only" check in the Available Letters and enables a new field, Number Of
	Letters (see below).  You may also want to use the WORDS dictionary,
	but any of them will work. 
</p>
<h2 id="lengthlen">Number of Letters</h2>
<p><a href="top">Top</a></p>
<p>
	The Number of Letters field holds the exact number of letters the suggested words should
	contain. It's value can be 0 - 20, or blank, which is the same as zero.  Zero or blank
	mean no restriction is applied.
