<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	<span class="emphasis">Scrabble Words</span> will help you find words to play in 
	the game of Scrabble.
	You enter letters of the tiles you have in your hand.  Optionally, you can enter
	a letter or letters on the board that the suggested word must contain.  You can 
	also enter the letters the suggested word must start with and end with.  Two
	dictionaries are supported: the Official Tournament and Club Word List, or TWL,
	(used in the USA) and SOWPODS (used in most other countries). 
</p>
<p>
	If you are familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
	Regular Expressions</a> you can use them to	limit your search.  Options can be 
	combined except <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span> and 
	<span class="quote">Contains Regex</span>, which are mutually exclusive.
</p>
<p>
	A list of suggested words is displayed when you press <span class="button">
	submit</span>.  All entered data is cleared when the <span class="button">
	clear</span> button is pressed.  The suggested words are displayed first by 
	highest value first and then if the values are the same, by alphabetical order. 
</p>
<p>
	<span class="emphasis">ScrabbleWords</span> has a limited ability to detect
	whether a word is a bingo (with an extra 50 points).  Specifically, it may fail
	to catch bingos if <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span> has more than one
	letter or if regular expressions are using.  This means it is possible (but not
	likely) that a bingo word may not display first in the suggested word list. 
</p>
<h2 id="available">Available Letters</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Enter the letters of the tiles in your hand.  If you have a blank tile, enter this as
	a dot (.).  Currently, the program cannot handle the situation where the player has
	both black tiles.
</p>
<h2 id="contains">Contains Letters / Regex</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Select either <span class="quote">Contains these letters</span> or 
	<span class="quote">Contains (with regex)</span>. 
</p> 
<h3>Contains Letters</h3>
<p>	
	Select
	the first option if you are only going to enter a letter or letters that the suggested 
	word must contain.  This would be a letter on the board that the suggested word will
	intersect.  If you enter more than one letter, the suggested word must contain 
	<span class="emphasis">all</span>
	letters, not necessarily in order or next to each other.  To get letter(s) in exact 
	positions in the words, use a regular expression.
</p>
<h3>Contains Regex</h3>
<p>
	Select the second option if know regular expressions and would like the suggested words 
	to match this instead of simple letters.  The regex will be tested to make sure it is a
	valid Java regular expression.  Note that you will have to add the letters from the 
	regex to <span class="quote">Available Letters</span>. 
</p>
<h2 id="startswith">Starts With</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Enter the letter or letters the suggested words should start with.  Do 
	<span class="emphasis">not</span> enter these letters in 
	<span class="quote">Available Letters</span>.
</p>
<h2 id ="endswith">Ends With</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Enter the letter or letters the suggested words should end with.  Do 
	<span class="emphasis">not</span> enter these letters in 
	<span class="quote">Available Letters</span>.
</p>
<h2 id="dictionary">Dictionary</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Select the dictionary to use.  Currently you have the choice between the Official Tournament 
	and Club Word List, or TWL, (used in the USA) and SOWPODS (used in most other countries).
