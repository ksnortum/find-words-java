<p>
	<span class="emphasis">Scrabble Words</span> will help you find words to play in 
	the game of Scrabble.
	You enter letters of the tiles you have in your hand.  Optionally, you can enter
	a letter or letters on the board that the suggested word must contain.  You can 
	also enter the letters the suggested word must start with and end with.  Three
	dictionaries are supported: The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, or OSPD;
	the Official Tournament and Club Word List, or TWL; and SOWPODS, which is used in 
	most countries outside the USA.
</p>
<p>
	If you are familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
	Regular Expressions</a> you can use them in <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span>
	to limit your search.  
</p>
<p>
	A list of suggested words is displayed when you press <span class="button">
	submit</span> or press the <span class="key">Enter</span> key.  All entered data 
	is cleared when the <span class="button">clear</span> button is pressed.  The 
	application can be closed with the <span class="key">Escape</span> button.
	The suggested words are displayed first by highest value first and then if the 
	values are the same, by alphabetical order. 
</p>
<p>
	<span class="emphasis">ScrabbleWords</span> has a limited ability to detect
	whether a word is a bingo (with an extra 50 points).  Specifically, it may fail
	to catch bingos if <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span> contains certain 
	regular expressions.  This means it is possible (but not
	likely) that a bingo word may not display first in the suggested word list. 
</p>
<h2 id="available">Available Letters</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Enter the letters of the tiles in your hand.  If you have a blank tile, enter this as
	a dot (.).  Currently, the program cannot handle the situation where the player has
	both black tiles.
</p>
<h2 id="contains">Contains Letters</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>	
	Enter letters on the board that the suggested word will intersect.  
	Regular expressions are allowed.  The regex will be tested to make sure it is a
	valid Java regular expression.  
</p>
<h2 id="startswith">Starts With</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Enter the letter or letters the suggested words should start with. (This is faster 
	than using "^" in a regular expression.)
</p>
<h2 id ="endswith">Ends With</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Enter the letter or letters the suggested words should end with. (This is faster 
	than using "$" in a regular expression.)
</p>
<h2 id="dictionary">Dictionary</h2>
<p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>
<p>
	Select the dictionary to use.  The default is OSPD.
